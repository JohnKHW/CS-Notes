## [[Database absolute level]]
1. [[Internal Level]]: Physics Storage
3. [[Conceptual Level]]: Logic data model of database
3. [[External Level]]: Contains all the application and the users

## [[Entity Relation Model]]
[[Entity]]: 
1. distinguishable and independent existence 
2. Same type entity can be call an entity set -> any set is a set of entities with the same type
3. <font color=#FF0000>Each entity are different</font>

[[Attribute]]: 
1. Describe entity

---
# Attribute Type
	An Attribute can be simple or composite attribute

## [[Simple attribute]]
[[Atomic Value]]
	For identify two entities which are unque and not repeated, also one entity only has one atomic value
- E.g:
	1. ID card no. for student

### [[Super key]]
	A set of one or mulitiple attributes
	Identify uniquely an entity in an entity set

### [[Candidate key]] ([[Support key]])
	A set of minimum attribute
	Fulfill minimum condition of another super key
	Candidate key use to find unique entity
An [[Entity]] can have many [[Candidate key]]
- E.g:
	sid+ name = super key
	-> sid = candidate key (sid x subset -> fulfill definetion of candidate key)
	-> name != candidate key (student name can be repeated -> x super key -> x candidate key)
	
### [[Primary key]]
	A candidate key chosen for identifying the entity or relation


#### [[Candidate key]] instead of [[Super key]]
	Short -> more efficiency 

## [[Composite attribute]]
Can be divided into mulitiple hierarchical structure
	e.g: 
	1. Degree for student
	2. Color for car


---

## [[Relation]]
	Association between the entities
1. One to one 
2. One to many
3. Many to many

## [[Constraint]]
	Defines whether every entity in the entity set participate in
	
---

## Connection
1. [[Cardinality constraint]]
	- Present the relation of the entity by using the number
2. [[Participation constraint]]
	- Single line: partitial participation
	- Double line: total participation

---

# Step of Drawing [[ER Diagram]]
1. Identify the entity set
2. Identify each and ever identify the attribute for each entity
3. Identify the relotionship of each entities
	
---

## [[Weak entity]]
	No candidate key
Use double outline to indicate it
-> Rely on some strong entity for identifing

## [[Partial key]]
	Cannot identify the entity and dependent
Use dashed line to connect
